# Registration Management System

I aimed to construct a simple Registration Management System (RMS) for an academic institution using PHP, Apache Web Server, and SQL database. In this project, users are registered by the admin with a unique email address. They are divided into three by their roles;

-   Administrator
-   Professors
-   Students

The capability of users changes base on their roles in the system. 


 > **Note:** This project developed for MIS233 - Web Based Application Programming Course in Bogazici University.

### Administrators

 - Change user status, 
 - Update their passwords, 
 - Set the system parameters, 
 - Get reports.

### Professors

 - View detailed information about their courses
 - Update their passwords.

### Students
