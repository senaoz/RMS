# Registration Management System
I aimed to construct a simple Registration Management System (RMS) for an academic institution using PHP technology, Apache Web Server, and SQL database. In this project, users registered by the admin and they are divided into three;
<ul>
<li>Administrator</li>
<li>Professors</li>
<li>Students</li>
  </ul>
The capability of users changes base on their roles in the system. Administrators; can register new users & courses, change user status, update their passwords, set the system parameters, and get reports. Professors; can submit the grades of their students, control their consent requests, view detailed information about their courses and update their passwords. Students; can add or remove courses on their list, ask for consent for courses, view detailed information about their courses and update their passwords.
